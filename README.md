# NZO Model

## Current TODOs:
- We might want to change the design of input fields
- Hebrew and RTL ?
- Shahar: fix interpolate function, or use the pandas one

## How to run:
1. Make sure you have a valid `credentials.json` under the `sources/` directory. You can use the template to create one.  
2. `python app.py`
